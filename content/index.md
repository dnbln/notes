title: Welcome to Dinu's knowledge garden
---
My name is Dinu, and here you can find my knowledge garden. I might use this place to store anything ranging from documentation for some of my projects, to random thoughts and everything in between, ~~*or not*~~. You may find every allotrope of Carbon here, charcoal and diamonds alike. Anyway, good luck, and I hope you can find what you came looking for; that being said, may the [table of contents](toc.md) guide you[^1].

[^1]: May or may not have been a Star Wars reference.
