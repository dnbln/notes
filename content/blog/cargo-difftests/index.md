This section of the blog contains a few blog posts which describe the evolution of [[cargo-difftests/index|cargo-difftests]].

- The [[part-3-upsilon-difftests|pre-introduction]] was a post from before `cargo-difftests` was extracted from my other major project at the time, [[blog/upsilon/index|upsilon]], for which it was more or less specifically made.
- [[introduction-old|The old introduction]] is from when I first announced the tool on r/rust. It has come a *very* long way since then.
- [[one-year-later|One year later]]: A post showing where `cargo-difftests` is/was 1 year after it was originally introduced (2023-02-12).
